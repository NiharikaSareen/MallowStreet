# MallowStreet

## Requirements:

###Task 1 

Make the provided test.html as “semantic” and “accessible” as possible, e.g. replace tags with more semantic ones, add attributes such as alt and aria-label. Please feel free to do what every you think is necessary, anything goes, including moving entire code blocks around, adding parent elements such as <article> or even removing elements entirely.


###Task 2

Use CSS to present the HTML in The Holy Grail layout. Again, please feel free to do what every you think is necessary; add additional id and class attributes to the HTML, decide on the best CSS layout feature to use, etc, to help get you as close as possible to the requested layout without breaking task 1.
